# Learning Node.js

This are the exercise files I've created  while following the [Learning Node.js course on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-node-js-2).

Node.js is a platform built on the Chrome JavaScript runtime that can help you build fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficientâ€”perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. In this course, learn the basics of Node.js, and discover how to build a simple application. Alexander Zanfir goes into topics such as npm, reading and writing files, and Node.js frameworks. He covers Node.js features, such as async/await, and dives into popular web development concepts. Alexander also walks through how to build a demo chat app from start to finish.
